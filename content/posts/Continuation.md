So, let's actually use this thing.

My plan now is to start updating this blog a little bit more than I have during the 3 years of it's existence.

## What has happend since the last time?

I have been busy at work, taking more responsibility and multiples roles.

I have been working as a consultant manager here at Knowit and learnt alot.

I have now changed my role again to be more focused on technology once again, going back to being a consultant but also a Innovation Leader (which I have been doing for almost two years now) in the Greenhouse Incubator that we we run here at Knowit.

We incubate sustainable startups and help them get up on their feet.

## What the plan going forward?

Well that always hard to say but I intend to blog more about my experiences in technology, especially within the Cloud/Innovation/Automotive/Telecom areas.

Hope to find you visiting this blog every once in a while.
