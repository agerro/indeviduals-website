## Who am I

My name is Marcus Karlsson and I'm a 26 years old tech enthusiast living and working in Gothenburg, Sweden.

## What do I do

I'm working as Consultant for Cybercom Group in Gothenburg, Sweden.
At Cybercom, I work as a Cloud consultant focusing mostly on AWS, but also many other areas surounding cloud in general.

Assignments at Cybercom for me has ranged between setting up container runtime environments, CI/CD, setting up multi clustered logging/metrics solutions and DevOps.

Seeing as my main focus of my daily work is "Enablement", automation in the form of Terraform/Ansible/CloudFormation has always been a core part of my day to day work.

## Why should you be interested

My intention is to write about stuff that I think about when it comes to technologies, tools and DevOps related topic; my hope is that you will find some information here that will either lead you to find something new, or that you just can get the feeling that you have learned something.
