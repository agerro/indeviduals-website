## Who am I

My name is Marcus Karlsson and I'm a 30 years old tech enthusiast living and working in Gothenburg, Sweden.

On my spare time, I spend a lot of my time making music and performing as a DJ. 

I'm always working on a project involving some sort of code. I have listed some of the projects that I do on the `Showcase` section of this site.

## What do I do

I'm working as Innovation Leader and Cloud Consultant for Knowit in Gothenburg, Sweden.
At Knowit, I work as a Cloud consultant focusing mostly on AWS, but also many other areas surounding cloud in general.

Assignments at Cybercom for me ranges between helping new customers adopt their business to Cloud, and adjusting their daily workflows accordingly.
We are also assisting a lot of our customers that either want to take the journey in exploring containerinzing their codebase and moving to Kubernetes, but also for those who has invested in Kubernetes but wants to take it to the next level.

Seeing as my main focus of my daily work is "Enablement", automation in any form has always been a core part of my day to day work.

## Why should you be interested

My intention is to write about stuff that I think about when it comes to technologies, tools and DevOps related topic. My hope is that you will find some information here that will either lead you to find something new, or that you just can get the feeling that you have learned something.
