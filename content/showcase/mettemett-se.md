## Description

With me small and unofficial hobby of meassuring things in the world like for example how long a benchtop is, or how wide the a coffe cup is; I got the idea of creating a website where you can input and search all these meassurements.

Sure, it all started as a joke that I liked to meassure things, but I saw it as a opportunity to learn how to created a fully fledged website managing all this.

So, this is where I started to create the website [mettemett.se](https://www.mettemett.se) where you can search meassurement and input them.

The ideas was to have it open for everyone so everyone can meassure everything.

This might be a good or a bad idea.

## Problems I had to face

Dealing with how DynamoDB actually works.

I had to deal with alot of issues tryig to design the database for this since DynamDB works a bit diffrent from how I expected.

I also needed to deal with learning more about front and backend with Express and NodeJS.

## What is it?

Sure, it all started as a joke that I liked to meassure things, but I saw it as a opportunity to learn how to created a fully fledged website managing all this.

The ideas was to have it open for everyone so everyone can meassure everything.

## Where can I get it myself?
